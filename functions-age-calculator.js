
Create a function to determine someone's age.

Define a function called ageCalculator. This function should take 3 parameters:

name - a string representing someones name
yearOfBirth - a number representing their year of birth
currentYear - a number representing the current year
The ageCalculator function should return a string explaining how old the person is. 
For example, if we called ageCalculator("Suzie", 1983, 2015);, 
the return value should be as follows:

return != console.log
console.log is great for debugging and inspecting code by printing values to the terminal
and is mostly used for this purpose. However, most functions are designed to return a
computed value to the caller instead of printing it to the terminal.

You should therefore carefully read for whether you need to return or log in your function.

"Suzie is 32 years old."

Tips:
You may paste the following code after your function definition to help you verify it 
works correctly.
console.log(ageCalculator("Miranda", 1983, 2015));
console.log(ageCalculator("Ferdinand", 1988, 2015));
